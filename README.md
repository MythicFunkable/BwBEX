# 🎈Better with Blimps EXtension (BwBEX)
A **[Figura](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura)** library designed for use with the Better with Blimps mod and its' existing compatibility API!

If you're looking for a function reference, please refer to the [wiki]().
## ✔️ Highlights
* An implementation of **animation smoothing** for your model's inflation in an attempt to improve immersion
* A function to **vibrate parts** as your scale increases, to emulate creaking
* **Model floating!** When you get big enough, you'll start to hover up and down.
## Installation
1. Have a Figura model at the ready. Make sure it at least has some form of inflation animation.
2. Download this library to the root of your model and import it to your primary script by planting the following code:
```lua
local BwBEX = require("BwBEX")
```
3. Do the same to the existing Better with Blimps API mod by CatChris. You can find it lurking around in one of the server's channels.

Congratulations! You're all done and ready to use what's inside!
